## Still Want Premium AI Voices?

If you want even higher quality voices, you can optionally add API keys to `.env.local`:
- OpenAI TTS (Alloy voice) - ~$0.015 per 1K characters
- ElevenLabs - Higher quality but more expensive
- Azure Cognitive Services - Good balance of quality and cost

But the free browser voices are excellent for most users! ðŸŽµ
