# 🇬🇧 British Male Voice Setup Guide

Your JoyScroll app now has enhanced British voice detection! Here's how to get the best British male narration.

## 🎯 Automatic Detection

The app now searches more aggressively for British voices in this priority order:

1. **Microsoft Edge voices**: Ryan, Thomas, George (en-GB)
2. **Google UK voices**: Any Google en-GB voice
3. **Neural British voices**: Any en-GB voice with "Neural" 
4. **Male British voices**: Any en-GB voice with "male"
5. **Common British names**: Daniel, Oliver, Arthur, Harry, James, William
6. **Any British voice**: Any en-GB, en_GB, or UK-labeled voice
7. **US fallbacks**: Neural/Premium US voices (if no British available)

## 🔧 Debugging Voice Selection

Open your browser console and run these commands to debug voice selection:

### Check Available Voices
```javascript
// See all available voices on your system
console.log(textToSpeech.getAllVoices())

// See only British voices
console.log(textToSpeech.getBritishVoices())

// See currently selected voice
console.log(textToSpeech.getSelectedVoice())
```

### Force Voice Reload
```javascript
// Force the browser to reload voices (sometimes needed)
textToSpeech.forceReloadVoices()
```

### Manually Set a Specific Voice
```javascript
// Set a specific voice by name (if you see one you want)
textToSpeech.setVoiceByName("Microsoft Ryan")
textToSpeech.setVoiceByName("Google UK English Male")
textToSpeech.setVoiceByName("Daniel")
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Voice Sounds American Instead of British**
1. Run `textToSpeech.getBritishVoices()` to see available British voices
2. If none found, install British voices via your OS settings
3. Run `textToSpeech.forceReloadVoices()` after installing
4. Manually set with `textToSpeech.setVoiceByName("Voice Name")`

### **No British Voices Available**
- Install British English speech packs via your operating system
- Use Microsoft Edge for the best free British voices
- The app will gracefully fall back to the best available English voice

## 🎉 Expected Result

When properly configured, you should hear:
- ✅ Clear British accent (not American)
- ✅ "Lord" pronounced naturally (not L-O-R-D)
- ✅ Natural pauses at punctuation
- ✅ Contemplative, reverent pace perfect for scripture

Enjoy your enhanced British narration! 🇬🇧📖
